Project Description: Job Portal System Using Python and MySQL:
This project is a lightweight job portal system designed to facilitate job management, candidate applications, and candidate-job matching. It is implemented using Python's core libraries and MySQL, focusing on minimalistic functionality and RESTful API development. The system allows employers to post job opportunities, candidates to apply, and administrators to manage records. The project includes features like database connectivity, data management, and basic notification handling.

Features:
Job Management: APIs to add, view, and manage job postings.
Candidate Management: APIs to add and view candidate details.
Application Management: APIs for candidates to apply for jobs and view the status of their applications.
Candidate-Job Matching: Python logic to match candidates to job requirements based on their skills.
Email Notifications: Integration with Pythonâ€™s smtplib to notify candidates about application updates.
Database Operations: CRUD operations using MySQL to store and retrieve data efficiently.

Technologies Used:
Backend: Python (HTTP server, MySQL connector, JSON handling).
Database: MySQL for structured data storage and querying.
API Testing: Postman for testing the endpoints.

Benefits:
Simplified Workflow: Automates job postings, applications, and notifications.
Skill-Based Matching: Matches candidates to job requirements efficiently.
Database Reliability: Ensures structured data management with MySQL.
Scalability: Can be extended with additional features like advanced matching algorithms or user authentication.
Practical Learning: A great hands-on project for learning REST API development and MySQL integration.
